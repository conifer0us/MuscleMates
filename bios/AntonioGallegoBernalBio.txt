My name is Antonio Gallego Bernal, I am a freshman at Drexel University studying Computer Science, and am currently considering double majoring in Mathematics. I am comfortable building simple web projects using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, as well as Python, although I'm always trying to expand my knowledge and learn new things. I have a background with a variety of foreign languages, so natural language processing and computational linguistics are fields that deeply interest me and would love to explore.
